						Whenever a pirate vessel comes into view, they all take turns
						looking at it through the sight, playing with all the different
						sensor modes:visible, infrared, and, so on. Eliot has spent enough
						time knocking around the Rim that he has become familiar with the
						colors of the different pirate groups, so by examining them, through
						the sight he can tell who they are: Clint Eastwood and his band
						parallel them for a few minutes one day,checking them out, and the
						Magnificent Seven send out one of their small boats to zoom by them
						and look for potential booty. Hiro's almost hoping they get taken
						prisoner by the Seven, because they have the nicest looking pirate
						ship: a former luxury yacht with Exocet launch tubes kludged to the
						foredeck. But this reconnaissance leads nowhere. The pirates,
						unschooled in thermodynamics, do not grasp the implications of the
						eternal plume of steam coming from beneath the life raft.
