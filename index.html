			Whenever a pirate vessel comes into view, they all take turns looking atit
			through the sight, playing with all the different sensor modes:visible,
			infrared, and so on. Eliot has spent enough time knocking aroundthe Rim
			that he has become familiar with the colors of the differentpirate groups,
			so by examining them through the sight he can tell who theyare: Clint
			Eastwood and his band parallel them for a few minutes one day,checking
			them out, and the Magnificent Seven send out one of their smallboats to
			zoom by them and look for potential booty. Hiro's almost hopingthey get
			taken prisoner by the Seven, because they have the nicest lookingpirate
			ship: a former luxury yacht with Exocet launch tubes kludged to
			theforedeck. But this reconnaissance leads nowhere. The pirates,
			unschooledin thermodynamics, do not grasp the implications of the eternal
			plume ofsteam coming from beneath the life raft.
